# CVE-Aggregator.py

## This Script is to  pulls CVEs from NVD for a quick morning daily briefing

## Requirements: python must be installed and the requests library is needed too (install with pip if needed)

## How to Run: execute in your terminal on mac/linux/windows. Make sure the file is executable. 

## On windows run: pyton CVE-Agregator.py | Out-File -FilePath CVE-Outut.txt -Encoding utf8

## This combats windows strange encoding since mac (unix) uses utf8 by default

## Output: CVE publish date, CVE #, CVE severity, and description.

##  Configuration: you may modify date by changing the days_back variable  to look back further than 7 days
